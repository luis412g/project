NUTRITIONIST BACKEND STORAGE SYSTEM

I have crated a the backend part of a nutritionist software, the main idea of this project is to help
nutritionist organize all their information in one app and allow them to generate automated templates
with charts that can show the progress of the patient by just inputing information. So far I have only implemented the creations of the users and patients. I have also worked on a few endpoints that I beleive could be useful for the front end part of the sofware. 

In the api file you will find three files, patients.py, users.py and pages.py. The patients file creates all the endpoints for anything related to the patient, the users files creates the endpoints for anything related to the user, in this case the nutritionist and the pages files creates endpoints to send html files to the browser.
